# VizPresidentialExitPolls

Takes CNN's presidential exit polls and visualizes them in D3.

# Files
`download.py` downloads the JSON files for each state and then stores them in data folders for 2012 and 2016. Not all states have exit poll data, e.g. Wyoming in 2016.

The national 2012 and 2016 exit polls are stored as `P2012.full.json` and `P2016.full.json`. These were downloaded manually.
